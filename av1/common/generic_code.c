         to ensure we don't drive any probabilities to 0. Replacing cdf[i] with

         tmp == i + 2 - (1 << rate). Using this value of tmp with

         probabilities to 0. Since right-shifting any negative value is still
         negative, we can solve (32768 - (n - 1 - i) - tmp == 0) for tmp,
         producing tmp = 32769 - n + i. Using this value of tmp with smaller
         values of cdf[i] instead gives negative adjustments, as desired.
